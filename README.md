Solutions to prelim (am3252)

The following repository contains answers to the Prelim. Following instructions will help you navigate through different answers.

1. The explanations and derivations for questions 1a, 1b, 1d, 2a, 2b,2c,2d,2e,2f are all present in the Prelim answers pdf.

2. The graphs related to 1d, 2c,2d,2e,2f are all present in the Prelim graphs .docx file. 

3. The data related to 1a(Sheet 3), 1c (Sheet2), 1d (Sheet1) is present in the Prelim Question 1 data and graphs excel workbook. 

4. The Julia program for question 2d is in the 2d.jl file 

5. The Julia program for question 2e is in the 2e.jl file. 
   This program uses the steady state values obtained from 2d for a point below the hopf bifurcation and above the saddle bifurcation
   and uses them as initial conditions u0 for steady state obtaines, u1 for 25% less and u2 for 25% more. 

6. The MATLAB program for constructing the toggle switch graph in 2c is present in the 2c stable.m file for plotting steady states only 
   and 2c Unstable.m for plotting steady and unsteady states.  For solving this question the derivatives of x and y w.r.t time were taken 
   as zero and the resulting system of equations was solved for x and varying values of S using the VPA solver in MATLAB.
